# Visualization of Crime in NYC (CSC59978 Final Project)

## Hosted Site with Embedded Visualizations
 - Link: https://rduraj96.github.io/crimenyc/
 - This is the easiest way to interact with our visualizations without the need for Tableau. It's simply an HTML file that's hosted on Github Pages with our visualizations embedded. 
 
 ## Links to Packaged Workbook Files (.twbx)
 - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q71Kh1V68d9XY6n5aJFrHL0F0f41X-kK/view?usp=sharing (map of number of crimes in each zipcode)
 - https://drive.google.com/file/d/18dF3kingbQVAq5p0bJ0_E-DZHX_KfFPx/view?usp=sharing (heatmap, histogram, density maps, and line chart)
 
 ## Instructions to Run Locally
 - To run our visualizations locally, you need to download the two packaged workbook files (.twbx) that are linked above.
 - Since they are large files, they are hosted on google drive (github has a 25mb cap) with download permissions.
 - Then with Tableau, you can open both of the packaged workbook files (both .twbx files) and our dataset and visualizations will be automatically loaded which you can then interact with.
 - It will take quite a while to initially open the workbook files (over 30 minutes) since tableau loads the dataset and then renders all the visualizations.
