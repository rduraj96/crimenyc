# Visualization of Crime in NYC (CSC59978 Final Project)

## Hosted Site with Embedded Visualizations
 - Link: https://rduraj96.github.io/crimenyc/
 - This is the easiest way to interact with our visualizations without the need for Tableau. Its simply an HTML file thats hosted on Github Pages with our visualizations embedded.
 
 ## To Run Locally
 - To run our visualizations locally you need to download the two packaged workbook files ()
 - Then with Tableau, you can open both of the packaged workbook files and our dataset and visualizations will be automatically loaded which you can then interact with.
